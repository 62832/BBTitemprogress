A simple Python script that displays a Steam user's item progress in [BattleBlock Theater](http://store.steampowered.com/app/238460/BattleBlock_Theater/). A list of all the item names (all base heads, star heads and weapons) is included, which has been pain-stakingly compiled off the market due to limited information anywhere else online.

Uses the [Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) module for Python.

**Note:** Pineapple Pete seems to be wrongly capitalised on Steam as "PIneapple Pete".
